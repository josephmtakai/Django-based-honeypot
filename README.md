Django-Based Honeypot

Project Description
This project is a Django-based honeypot designed to attract attackers by simulating various vulnerabilities. It includes fake login pages, vulnerable endpoints, and other traps to log and analyze attacker activities. The project also features a real-time monitoring dashboard for visualizing attack data and generating detailed reports.

Features
Fake Login Pages: Simulated login interfaces to attract brute-force attempts.
Vulnerable Endpoints: Intentional vulnerabilities designed to be exploited.
Detailed Logging: Comprehensive logs capturing attacker behavior.
Real-Time Monitoring: A dashboard for real-time visualization of attacks.
Analysis & Reporting: Tools for analyzing collected data and generating reports.

Learning Outcomes
Understanding the role and function of honeypots in cybersecurity.
Gaining experience with both secure and insecure Django components.
Developing skills in logging, monitoring, and reporting attacker activities.
